the hadith was then poorly validated while contemporary accounts of Muhammad's life were better known\nAs the hadith came to be better documented,  the sunnah came often to be known mostly through the hadith\nHow far hadith contributes to sunnah is disputed and highly dependent on context\nA hadith is a saying or an act or tacit approval or disapproval ascribed either validly or invalidly to the Islamic prophet Muhammad\nHadith are regarded by traditional Islamic schools of jurisprudence as important tools for understanding the Quran and in matters of jurisprudence\nHadith were evaluated and gathered into large collections during the 8th and 9th centuries; referred to in matters of Islamic law and history to this day\nThe largest denominations of Islam, Sunni, Shi\u02BBa, and Ibadi, rely upon different sets of hadith collections\nClerics and jurists of all denominations classify individual hadith as sahih (authentic), hasan (good) and da'if (weak)\nDifferent traditions within each denomination, and different scholars within each tradition, may differ as to which hadith should be included in which category\nIn Arabic the word hadith means 'a piece of information conveyed either in a small quantity or large'\nIn Islamic terminology, the term hadith refers to reports of statements or actions of Muhammad, or of his tacit approval or criticism of something said or done in his presence\nThe word sunnah (custom) is also used in reference to a normative custom of Muhammad or the early Muslim community\nHadith Qudsi (or Sacred Hadith) is a sub-category of hadith which are sayings of Muhammad\nMuslims regard the Hadith Qudsi as the words of God (Arabic: Allah), repeated by Muhammad and recorded on the condition of an isnad\nAccording to some,  the Hadith Qudsi differ from the Quran in that the former are \"expressed in Muhammad's words\", whereas the latter are the \"direct words of God\n\n\n\n\n\n\nweb stuff\n---------\nZepto is a minimalist JavaScript library for modern browsers with a largely jQuery-compatible API\nxui - a super micro tiny DOM library for authoring HTML5 mobile web applications\nJo - the simple app framework for HTML5\nJo is a SPA framework for mobile, native-like widgets and UI controls\nXRegExp is an open source (MIT License) JavaScript library that provides augmented and extensible regular expressions\nXRegExp gives new syntax, flags, and methods beyond what browsers support natively\nWYSIHTML5 - A better approach to rich text editing\nWYSIHTML5 Unifies line break handling across browsers\nThe WebFont Loader is a JavaScript library that gives you more control over font loading than the Google Web Fonts API provides\nThe WebFont Loader was co-developed by Google and Typekit\nVisibility.js allows you to determine whether your web page is visible to a user, is hidden in background tab or is prerendering\nVisibility.js allows you to use the page visibility state in JavaScript logic and improve browser performance by disabling unnecessary timers and AJAX requests\nURI.js is a javascript library for working with URLs\nUnderscore.string is JavaScript library for string manipulation (can use with or without underscore)\nWebGL, the new standard for 3D rendering on the Web and a member of HTML5\u2019s family of technologies\nXamarin 2.0 Product Review - Android and iOS development in C# just got easier\nChosen is a JavaScript plugin that makes long, unwieldy select boxes much more user-friendly\nblueimp is a File Upload widget with multiple file selection, drag&drop support, progress bars and preview images for jQuery\nzurb is a responsive front-end framework\n\nBackbone.Marionette is a composite application library for Backbone.js\nMarionette includes pieces inspired by composite application architectures, event-driven architectures, messaging architectures\nthe Scatter/Gather pattern: broadcasts a message to multiple recipients and re-aggregates the responses back into a single message\n\n\ngeneca\n------\nJames Rapp was in Seattle, worked as a program manager for the VS2012 concurrency visualizer!\n\n\n\nko\n--\nknockout checkboxes: check event sends previous value;

In general, \"package\" is the thing that you can download, and contains a component, which is a group of one or more assets\nA Bower component has a bower.json file that describes the component and its dependencies\n> bower search angular\n> bower search angular | grep \"phonegap\"\nangular-dragon-drop: \"drag and drop\" directives for AngularJS (very simplistic for now)\n";
